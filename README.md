# Mastermind-and-Wordle
The program should implement a minigame selector where you could play different games
with the computer or with another person. The program should have the following games and features:

Mastermind:
Game where you have to guess an unknown order of 4 colours.
The player is given info on how many colours that the player chose are in the order and how many are in the right spot, but not which ones specifically.
The game should have a single player version, where the order is chosen by the program and a two player version, where the second player can choose it.
The game will then output the final display to a file.
        
Wordle:
Hit internet game where you guess a pre-set 5-letter word.
Tells the player with specific letters are correct, and which are in the word but out of place.
The game should have a single player version, where the word is chosen by reading from a file, and two player version where the second player chooses the word.
The game will then output the final display to a file.
    

External Features:
Ability To Exit Program
When selecting game, loops until exit

Made as Year 1, Sem 1 Project for CPS109.
